The "diehard" random number tester was downloaded from:

    http://stat.fsu.edu/~geo/diehard.html

To test a random number generator, unpack and compile die.c 
with:

    tar xvzf die.c.tgz
    cd die.c
    make

This makes the "diehard" program which tests random number
generators with a variety of statistical tests. 

You can make a random number set with the "rndtest" program
(taken from the nc source code) using either "rnd_glibc", 
"rnd_taus", or "rnd_mt" (taus is default).  To switch to a
different random number generator, uncomment it in "rndtest.cc".

The "rnd_glibc" functions are very fast and work OK with a state
size of 128 bytes (or larger) but for smaller state sizes the
"diehard" program shows correlations (using #6, Monkey tests
OPSO,OQSO,DNA).

The "rnd_mt" functions have the longest period, 10^6000, but
are a little slower than rnd_taus.

The rnd_taus functions use a smaller state space (12 bytes)
and are very fast, with a period of 10^26.

Therefore we use the GSL "taus" generator by default.
