Coupling in an Integrative Model of the Cardiac Ventricular Myocyte Biophysical
Journal 90:77-91

    ABSTRACT 
It is now well established that characteristic properties of
excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in cardiac myocytes, such as high gain and
graded Ca21 release, arise from the interactions that occur between L-type Ca21
channels (LCCs) and nearby ryanodine-sensitive Ca21 release channels (RyRs) in
localized microdomains. Descriptions of Ca21-induced Ca21 release (CICR) that
account for these local mechanisms are lacking from many previous models of the
cardiac action potential, and those that do include local control of CICR are
able to reconstruct properties of EC coupling, but require computationally
demanding stochastic simulations of ;105 individual ion channels. In this
study, we generalize a recently developed analytical approach for deriving
simplified mechanistic models of CICR to formulate an integrative model of the
canine cardiac myocyte which is computationally efficient. The resulting model
faithfully reproduces experimentally measured properties of EC coupling and
whole cell phenomena. The model is used to study the role of local redundancy
in L-type Ca21 channel gating and the role of dyad configuration on EC
coupling. Simulations suggest that the characteristic steep rise in EC coupling
gain observed at hyperpolarized potentials is a result of increased functional
coupling between LCCs and RyRs. We also demonstrate mechanisms by which
alterations in the early repolarization phase of the action potential,
resulting from reduction of the transient outward potassium current, alters
properties of EC coupling.

The factors responsible for the regulation of regenerative calcium-induced
calcium release (CICR) during Ca(2+) spark evolution remain unclear. Cardiac
ryanodine receptor (RyR) gating in rats and sheep was recorded at physiological
Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model of the cardiac
dyad, which reproduced the time course of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) blinks, and
Ca(2+) spark restitution. The termination of CICR by induction decay in the
model principally arose from the steep Ca(2+) dependence of RyR closed time,
with the measured sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) lumen Ca(2+) dependence of
RyR gating making almost no contribution. The start of CICR termination
was strongly dependent on the extent of local depletion of junctional SR
Ca(2+), as well as the time course of local Ca(2+) gradients within the
junctional space. Reducing the dimensions of the dyad junction reduced
Ca(2+) spark amplitude by reducing the strength of regenerative feedback
within CICR. A refractory period for Ca(2+) spark initiation and
subsequent Ca(2+) spark amplitude restitution arose from 1), the extent
to which the regenerative phase of CICR can be supported by the partially
depleted junctional SR, and 2), the availability of releasable Ca(2+) in
the junctional SR. The physical organization of RyRs within the
junctional space had minimal effects on Ca(2+) spark amplitude when more
than nine RyRs were present. Spark amplitude had a nonlinear dependence
on RyR single-channel Ca(2+) flux, and was approximately halved by
reducing the flux from 0.6 to 0.2 pA. Although rat and sheep RyRs had
quite different Ca(2+) sensitivities, Ca(2+) spark amplitude was hardly
affected. This suggests that moderate changes in RyR gating by
second-messenger systems will principally alter the spatiotemporal
properties of SR release, with smaller effects on the amount released.

Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) is an inherently regenerative process
due to the Ca2 +-dependent gating of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the
sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR) and is critical for cardiac
excitation?contraction coupling. This process is seen as Ca2 + sparks, which
reflect the concerted gating of groups of RyRs in the dyad, a specialised
junctional signalling domain between the SR and surface membrane. However, the
mechanism(s) responsible for the termination of regenerative CICR during the
evolution of Ca2 + sparks remain uncertain. Rat cardiac RyR gating was recorded
at physiological Ca2 +, Mg2 + and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model
of the cardiac dyad which reproduced the time-course of Ca2 + sparks, Ca2 +
blinks and Ca2 + spark restitution. Model CICR termination was robust,
relatively insensitive to the number of dyadic RyRs and automatic. This
emergent behaviour arose from the rapid development and dissolution of
nanoscopic Ca2 + gradients within the dyad. These simulations show that CICR
does not require intrinsic inactivation or SR calcium sensing mechanisms for
stability and cessation of regeneration that arises from local control at the
molecular scale via a process we call ?induction decay?.
