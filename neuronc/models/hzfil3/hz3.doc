hz266.n: 60 x 60 array
	 stimulus: small spot

hz267.n: same as hz266 but 80 x 80 array

hz268.n: same as hz266 but 22 um line, with 44 um blur 
	 stimulus intensity 25 times lower
	 stimulus saturated

hz269.n: same as hz268 except 22 um blur

hz270.n: same as hz269 except
	 stimulus intensity 10 times lower
	     (250 times lower than hz266)


hz271.n: same as hz266 but 30 x 30 array

hz272.n: same as hz266 but 40 x 40 array

hz273.n: same as hz266 except
	   1) different hz locations 
	   2) different default gj cond: 100e-9
	   3) different default expon: expona 2, exponb 5

hz274.n: same as hz273 except
	   1) gap junctions between both hz types
	   2) both types default Hz gj cond: 100e-9

hz275.n: same as hz274 except
	   1) bar like hz269
	   2) 22 um blur (diff than hz269)
	   3) inten like hz269

		inten should be too much, therfore need hz276

hz276.n: same as hz275 except
	   1) 22 um blur (diff than hz270)
	   2) inten like hz270

hz280.n: same as hz274 except
	   1) cov_b = 6 (instead of 8)	
	   2) default exponb = 4 (instead of 5)
           3) default hbgjcond = 20e-9 (instead of 100e-9)

hz281.n: same as hz280 except
           1) default hbgjcond = 5e-9 (instead of 20e-9)

hz282.n: same as hz281 except
           1) cclamp on all cones, value of "cstim"

hz283.n: same as hz282 except
	   1) extra feedback synapses, with slow time constant
		time const = fstau
		gain = expons

hz284.n: same as hz281 except
           1) default conda,b = 2e-10 instead of 1e-9
		      condf   = 1e-10 instead of 1e-9
                      exponb  = 2     instead of 4
