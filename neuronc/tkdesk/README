The files in this directory are meant for use with "tkdesk", an X
file manager available for the Linux operating system.  They give
tkdesk the ability to recognize standard montage file types, so
that you can display NeuronC displays and graphs by clicking on
their icons.  

Tkdesk has a file manager and an application bar, much like a
commonly used 'doze commercial operating system.  Tkdesk gives
you the ability to "drag-'n-drop" icons to automatically run
commands.  New commands can be created by dragging an icon to the
screen background.

To use the tkdesk files in this directory, first install "tkdesk"
(at the time of this writing, the latest version is tkdesk-1.0,
available from http://people.mainz.netsurf.de/~bolik/tkdesk/).
Then copy the contents of the dottkdesk directory to .tkdesk in
your home directory. This overwrites the default configuration
files with the ones included here (but I started with the
defaults so you aren't losing much). Copy the pixmap files into
your /usr/local/lib/TkDesk/images directory (or other suitable
location, check the tkdesk path). Copy the files in bin to a
directory that is in your path, such as /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin.

tkdesk is part of several distributions of Linux available at:
