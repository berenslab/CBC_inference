<h2>RECENT    NEWS 
</h2>

<h3> Many improvements have been made since the NeuronC simulator was
first described in J. Neuroscience Methods in 1992.  </h3> 

<h3>
Highlights 
</h3>

<li> The <b>retsim</b> retinal simulator script generates a model
of a ganglion cell and its presynaptic circuit. Both interpreted and 
compiled versions are provided.
<p>

<li> Completely <b>compiled version of NeuronC</b> is now available.
Construction mode runs ~2-3 fold faster, and all the power of C++, 
and widely used math and matrix libraries is available.
<p>

<li> <b>Save</b> and <b>restore</b> a simulation's state. This allows you to
equilibrate a model, then save it for a later restore operation.
This saves time when running repetitive models.
<p>

<li> <b>Calcium</b> T- and L-type channels, Ca diffusion, dynamic
buffering, membrane transporters, and realistic Ca currents from
GHK equations.<p>

<li> <b>GHK current equation</b> can be utilized for any channel type.<p>

<li> The simulator runs several <b>channel types</b> including Markov
sequential-state versions of Hodgkin-Huxley Na, Nav1.1, Nav1.6, K, KA, 
Kca and Ih channels. AMPA, NMDA, cGMP, and GABA ligand-gated Markov
channels. Channel types contain individual <b>data structures</b> for
unitary conductance, rate functions, temperature dependence of
conductance and rates, relative permeabilities to major ions,
and sensitivities to receptor ligands.<p>
  
<li> Synaptic and voltage-gated channel functions can implement
<b>Markov</b> channel descriptions. Noise kinetics derived from Markov
description. Synaptic, channel, and photoreceptor noise can originate in
<b>independent noise generators</b> to maintain the same noise
waveshape when you change the neural circuit. Synapses can be 
controlled <b>calcium concentration</b>, allowing a presynaptic terminal's 
release to be defined by any calcium channel type.<p>

<li> Photoreceptors have <b>adaptation</b> through feedback from
calcium. The photoreceptor <b>spectral sensitivity functions</b> have
second-order interpolation from sensitivity tables and turtle
cone functions (default=primate). Photoreceptor kinetics can be
varied, and their state can be stored and recalled to save on
equilibration time. Stimuli and optical blur can be generated at
any scale (default=1 um) to allow very fine resolution.<p>

<li> The <b>stimulus generator</b> can create spot, bar, grating, gabor,
or concentric stimuli.  Transparency and masking allow
combinations of stationary objects and motion.  Stimuli can be in
any wavelength and with any blur or scatter function.
Point-spread functions for the human eye at 2 and 5.8 mm pupils
are included.<p>

<li> The simulator generates <b>realistic images</b> of neural
circuits using the "povray" ray tracer, and <b>movies</b> of the spread of
voltage or calcium in neural circuits, and can display them
at a variable rate for careful study. <p>

<h4>
Feb, 2018 addition:  
</h4>
<li>The model of channel-rhodopsin-2 from Williams et al (2013) 
has been added. This model is one of the most complete models of 
channel-rhodopsin. It can be run with or without noise properties.
It shows adaptation from bright photopic (daylight) light levels, 
and qualitatively matches channel-rhodopsin in transgenic mice.
</li>
<p>

<hr>
<h4>
Dec, 2017 addition:  
</h4>
<li>The model of mouse rod phototransduction from Invergo et al (2014) 
has been added. This model is one of the most complete models of rod 
phototransduction and contains 96 differential equations. It shows
adaptation well into photopic (daylight) light levels, and qualitatively
matches transgenic knockouts of the transduction cascade.
</li>
<p>

<hr>
<h4>
Dec, 2016 additions:  
</h4>
<li> Several new random number sequence generators have been added, 
a) Mersenne Twister, b) Tiny MT, c) Taus113.  Each of the random
sequence generators has its advantage. They can all be started at
different points in their sequences with a seed, which can be set
constant or can change automatically with each job. The original Taus
sequence (from GSL) is the fastest, with a sequence length of
2^88 (10^26), Taus113 is almost as fast with a sequence length of
2^113 (10^34), the Mersenne Twister has a very long sequence
(2^19937) and is almost as fast as Taus113, and TinyMT is a
little slower, but can generate many different sequences. 
</li><p>

<li>A model of CICR has been added, which is important for some
synapses because it can produce extra gain.  Several new channel
types have been added (NMDA, GABA, CYCG). A new method for
fitting models to data has been added.  Called "modelfit", it
allows multi-stage Levenberg-Marquardt fitting (Stincic et al.,
2016).
<p>


<hr>
<h4>
2014 additions:  
</h4>
<li> Previously only Ca channels used the GHK current equation. Now any channel
type, both voltage-gated and ligand-gated, can utilize the nonlinear GHK
equation, based on ionic gradients set from the overall defaults, or gradients
specifically defined for the channel type, or gradients defined for the
specific channel.
<p>

<li>
An expanded least-squares model fitting program has been added. It is called
"modelfit", and uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for fitting. It runs the
simulator, either "nc" or "retsim" and provides a command line with parameters
selected by the LM fitting algorithm. Up to 12 parameters can be fitted, each
limited (if wanted) to a specific range. The output of the simultor is
correlated with a template that selects which part of the output to compare to
the original data. A simple program is included to create templates that can be
edited with a text editor.

To increase fitting speed, the modelfit program can run in parallel on several
processors or computers in a network (using Mosix job tasking).
