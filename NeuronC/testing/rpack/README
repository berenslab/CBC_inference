The files in this directory are useful for
measuring the speed of "nc" with the Rallpack
standard benchmarks.

The files "rcabl2" and "rax2" will run Rallpack1 and Rallpack3
respectively.  The "comp" script will then cut the output
of "nc" and arrange the columns so that it can be compared with
the "ref_cable.x" files from the rallpack benchmark (available
from ftp to "mordor.cns.caltech.edu").  To use "comp" you must
first compile all the ".c" files in this directory.

   Usage:  comp filename
