###  as well as to custom events defined by you.

### The command for playing sound files. %s will be replaced by the sounds
### filename. Just comment out this line if you don't want to have sound.
### (Note: this must be a shell command, not a Tcl command. If the first
### element of the command can't be executed, sound is automatically
### disabled. The "play" command is part of the sox sound utilities
### ("play" is just a link to "sox") available from:
### ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/apps/sound/convert/Lsox-linux.tar.gz)

set tkdesk(soundcmd) "play %s &"

### The following lines define the file names of sounds for various TkDesk
### events. If the sound file name is not absolute, TkDesk will look for
### the sound in each directory given by the variable tkdesk(path,sounds),
### which is defined in the config file "System". The sound files of the
### lines that are commented out (and some more) can soon be obtained from the
### TkDesk WWW page: http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk/
