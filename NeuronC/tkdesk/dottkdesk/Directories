###  Directories (TkDesk Configuration File)
###
###  This file defines the configurable part of TkDesk's "Directories" menu,
###  as well as directories which are to be "hidden" when displayed in
###  browser windows. Also contains a list for executing a Tcl script
###  when certain directories are opened (to facilitate "auto-mounting").

### Definition of "Directories" menu entries:
### The entries are defined by the elements of a Tcl list.
### (In the following I try to explain its structure, although it will
### probably best to just have a look at the example definition below.)
### Basically, each list element contains a path, that will be added to
### the "Directories" menu. If this element contains more than one element
### a cascaded menu is created, and so on. See below for an example.
### The element {-} adds a separator to the menu. If a path is preceded
### by an "*", TkDesk will automatically create a recursive cascaded
### submenu for that path. These entries will be marked by a trailing "(*)"
### in the "Directories" menu.

set tkdesk(directories) {
    {~
	{~/Mail}
	{~/News}
    }
    {/
	{*/etc}
	{/lib}
	{/tmp}
    }
    {/usr
	{/usr/bin}
	{/usr/include
	    {/usr/include/sys}
	    {-}
	    {/usr/include/X11}
	    {/usr/include/X11/Xaw}
	}
	{/usr/lib}
	{*/usr/src}
	{*/usr/tmp}
    }
    {/usr/local
	{/usr/local/bin}
	{/usr/local/include}
	{/usr/local/lib}
    }
}


### "Strip" Directories:
### Here you can define directories whose parent directories are not to be
### displayed in file browser windows, as is usually the case with your
### home directory. This means: if you add /usr/local/lib to the list below,
### the leftmost listbox in a file browser window will contain the contents
### of /usr/local/lib, if you change to that directory or any child directory. 
### The contents of /usr and /usr/local is not displayed.
### This can speed things up, especially with AFS directory trees.

set tkdesk(strip_parents) {
    /afs
    /usr/X11/lib/X11
}


### On Open Actions:
### This list lets you define actions TkDesk should execute before opening
### or refreshing the specified directories. The main purpose of this is the
### "auto-mounting" of removable media devices, but you could also have a
### certain sound played when entering a directory, or whatever.
### The structure is similar to the popup lists: Each element of the list
### defined in the following consists of two elements. The first is a list
### of shell-like "glob" patterns. If a directory matches any of the patterns
### defined for an entry, the script given by the second element of each
### entry will be executed.
### This script may contain the following abbreviations:
###
### %s : Full pathname of the first selected file.
### %f : Its filename only.
### %b : "Basename": just the filename without extension.
### %d : Its directory only.
### %A : List containing full pathnames of all selected resp. dropped files.
### %B : Same as %A, but will be replaced with "" if no files are selected.
### %D : Directory of last "active" viewer.
