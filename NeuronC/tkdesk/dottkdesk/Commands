### Definition of "Command" menu entries:
### The entries are defined by the elements of a Tcl list.
### (In the following I try to explain its structure, although it will
### probably best to just have a look at the example definition below.)
### Each element of the list is again a Tcl list, whose first element
### is the label of the entry, while the second element contains a Tcl
### script that is to be executed when this entry is invoked.
### Cascaded menus are also possible, see below for an example.
###
### TkDesk commands that can be used in the list definition:
### (Only the most common ones are listed here. For a complete overview
### and a detailed explanation refer to the User's Guide.)
###
### dsk_exec cmd ...   : Executes shell command cmd in background.
### dsk_view cmd ...   : Executes cmd, displays output in Editor window.
