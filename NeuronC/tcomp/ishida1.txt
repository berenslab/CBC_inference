Andy,

  Here is a script of a one-compartment ganglion cell.  Please
let me what you can do with it.  It has several channels defined
as in the Fohlmeister & Miller model, and I've also added Ih.

  The rate functions are defined in the script file.  Their names
are special, and any function with that name overrides the
default function in the simulator. I imagine that the first thing
you'll want to do is change the rate functions.

  You can run several "experiments" by setting the "expt"
variable from the command line (or in the script, call it gc.n) like this: 

   nc -v --expt 1.1 gc.n | vid
  
Expt=1 is the plot of minf, hinf, mtau, and htau.  You can set 

expt=1.1    for   Na
expt=1.2    for   Kdr
expt=1.3    for   KA
expt=1.4    for   Ih

To plot the currents in voltage clamp mode, set expt=2.  This
displays 4 graphs on the screen.  The experiment is a cell that
is voltage clamped through a resistor.  The capacitive transients
are canceled by subtracting corresponding transients from a dummy
cell with no active channels.  It is pretty obvious that the
voltage clamp isn't so good when Rm >= 1e6 Ohms.

To see the currents in current clamp mode during a spike, set expt=3.
This generates a spike at 2 msec and plots the membrane voltage
and the separate channel currents.

To see spike train behavior, set expt=4.

My hope is that you can understand how the script works and then
fine-tune it for your own purposes.  If you have any questions
about the script or the simulator, please let me know. I would be
happy to explain it further or to make changes. 

You'll need to download the latest version of the simulator
(5.4.16) and compile it.  I hope this isn't too much work for
you.

Best wishes,

Rob
